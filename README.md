## Description

This challenge involved designing a web page that pulled data from a Server API (OpenWeather API) and displaying that in 2 views: one for today's weather, and one section for a 5-day forecast. The web page also has functionality of storing the user's 5 most recent searches to assist with pulling up that data quicker.

I learnt how to wrap a `fetch` method within a function, and how to convert the received `.JSON` into a readable `object`, from which I could interpret information in a user-friendly way. It also allowed me to practice `jQuery` and vanilla `JavaScript`.
